  I am currently a 4th-year PhD candidate in the [Statistics Science program](https://statistics.artsandsciences.baylor.edu/) at Baylor University, located in Waco, TX. My academic journey began in the Ashanti region of Ghana, where I was born and raised. I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Actuarial Science from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST). Following this, I pursued and obtained a Master of Science degree in Statistics from Montana State University, under the esteemed supervision of [Dr. Mark Greenwood](https://math.montana.edu/directory/faculty/1524138/mark-greenwood).

  At Baylor University, I am privileged to work under the guidance of [Dr. Joon J. Song](https://statistics.artsandsciences.baylor.edu/person/dr-joon-jin-song) and [Dr. Thierry Chekouo](https://sites.google.com/site/chekouoresearch/home?authuser=0). My current research is centered on the application of spatial methodology in modeling predictions within symbolic data, as well as the detection of spatially expressed genes in spatial transcriptomic analysis. Through these research, I aim to contribute to advancements in statistical science and its applications in biomedical and genomic studies.

  Beyond my academic and research pursuits, I am a passionate music enthusiast and enjoy spending time with my partner, friends, and family. I also love watching soccer and basketball, which provide a perfect balance to my research and studies.
