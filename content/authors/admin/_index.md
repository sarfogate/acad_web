I am a 4th-year PhD candidate in the [Statistics Science program](https://statistics.artsandsciences.baylor.edu/) at Baylor University, Waco TX. I was born in the Ashanti region of Ghana. I hold a Bachelors degree in Actuarial Science and a MS degree in Statistics.   

I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Joon J. Song](https://statistics.artsandsciences.baylor.edu/person/dr-joon-jin-song) and [Prof. Thierry Chekouo](https://sites.google.com/site/chekouoresearch/home?authuser=0), currently focusing on using spatial methodology in modelling predictions in Symbolic data and detection of spatially expressed gene in spatial transcriptomic analysis.

When I have some time to spare, I enjoy listening to music, spending time with my fiance, friends and family and watching soccer (I'm a staunch fan of Manchester United).
