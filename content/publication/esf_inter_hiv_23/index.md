abstract: This study evaluated the effectiveness of a 3R model-based behavioral intervention to promote cervical cancer screening among HIV-positive women in Ghana. The intervention group, receiving voice-recorded messages, achieved a high screening rate compared to the control group. Additionally, a high prevalence of high-risk HPV genotypes was observed. The intervention proved acceptable, feasible, and appropriate, leading to increased screening and early detection of pre-cancerous lesions.
