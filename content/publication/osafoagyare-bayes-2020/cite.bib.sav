 abstract = {We compare federal election results for each state versus the USA in every
 second year from 1992 to 2016 to model partisan lean of each state and its dependence
 on the nationwide popular vote. For each state, we model both its current partisan lean
 and its rate of change, as well as sensitivity of state results with respect to the
 nationwide popular vote, using a Bayesian Hierarchical Model. We then apply this model
 to predict and compare results with the actual values for the 2018 election.},
