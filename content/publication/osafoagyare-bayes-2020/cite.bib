  abstract    = {Statistical learning was introduced in the 1960s with its purpose being estimation of theoretical
functions, until the 1990s where technological advancement helped improved this area of study
to a practical algorithm tool. This area of statistics is thoroughly developed for quantitative
or categorical responses. However, it has also been extended to survival data. Most survival
data analyses use methods such as the Cox Proportional Hazard model in their analysis, but
the proportional hazards (PH) assumption is a strong assumption of this method and is often
violated. The statistical learning tool Random Survival Forests (RSF) was suggested to be
a good alternative for the Cox proportional hazards model when the PH assumptions are
violated and they also can have better predictive performance by incorporating interactions
and nonlinear functions of quantitative predictors.
The objective of this study was to apply Random Survival Forests (RSF) to time to
resolution of missing persons case in Montana from 2017 to 2019 and compare this statistical
learning method to conventional statistical methods used in survival analysis.
The study findings indicate that the Random Survival Forests (RSF) model has a
better prediction error than the Cox model and Kaplan Meier curves based on Brier scores but
the difference is minimal. Using the C-Index as a prediction evaluation, the Random Survival
Forests (RSF) model performed better in the initial time but was overtaken by the Cox model
at later time points. From the RSF model, age, region, cases reported on reservation, and race
are seen to be important for the time to resolution of a missing person case},
