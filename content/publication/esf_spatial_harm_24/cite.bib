  abstract    = {Merging spatial data from different networks can offer several advantages, including accurate prediction
  and reduced uncertainty. However, data are often collected in different ways,
  resulting in heterogeneity among networks. Data Harmonization is a statistical
  approach for merging diverse datasets to ensure compatibility and consistency.
  In the last decades, vast and complex datasets have been frequently generated.
  These datasets are typically too large and dynamic to be effectively managed and
  analyzed using traditional methods. Symbolic data analysis has recently been employed to
  simplify analysis and summarize information from data instead of using large data sets while
  retaining as much information as possible. In this study, we propose a harmonized kriging for
  spatial interval-valued data to perform efficient and accurate prediction for large volumes of
  spatial data. A simulation study illustrates the superiority of the proposed method as compared to
  kriging with pooled or referenced data. We demonstrate the application of harmonized kriging using
  interval-valued temperature data from three distinct monitoring networks in South Korea.},
