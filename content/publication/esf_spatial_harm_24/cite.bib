 abstract = {Linear regression sometimes present us with the problem of 
 high dimensionality â€“especially when the covariates, p is far greater than
 the sample size, n. A frequentist approach to tackling such problems include
 adopting shrinkage methods via penalization. However, penalization methods
 present yet another challenge of quantifying parameter uncertainties.
 Bayesian approach gives us the power to quantity parameters via estimating
 the posterior distribution for such parameters using Markov Chain
 Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. With such high dimensional shrinkage methods,
 we need super fast MCMC algorithms that are efficient and 
 computationally relative inexpensive. In this simulation study, 
 we compare and show that the two-Block Gibbs samplers (2BG) is a more efficient
 state of the art MCMC algorithm relative to the three-Block Gibbs samplers (3BG)
 method in estimating the posterior distributions of two commonly used
 Bayesian shrinkage models, viz: the Bayesian Lasso (BL) and the Spike-and-Slab
 shrinkage priors. Our criteria for evaluation include the one-lag autocorrelation
 and the average effective sample size per second, Neff/T. Consequently,
 we apply these methods on the protein expression genetics data from the
 National cancer Institute.},
