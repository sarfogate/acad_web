abstract: Merging spatial data from different networks can offer several advantages,
including accurate prediction and reduced uncertainty. However, data are often collected in different ways,
resulting in heterogeneity among networks. Data Harmonization is a statistical approach for merging diverse
datasets to ensure compatibility and consistency. In the last decades, vast and complex datasets have been
frequently generated. These datasets are typically too large and dynamic to be effectively managed
and analyzed using traditional methods. Symbolic data analysis has recently been employed to simplify 
analysis and summarize information from data instead of using large data sets while retaining as much 
information as possible. In this study, we propose a harmonized kriging for spatial interval-valued data
to perform efficient and accurate prediction for large volumes of spatial data. 
A simulation study illustrates the superiority of the proposed method as compared to kriging
with pooled or referenced data. We demonstrate the application of harmonized kriging using 
interval-valued temperature data from three distinct monitoring networks in South Korea.
