abstract: The study examined whether the 3R (reframe, prioritize, and reform) communication model intervention
can impact parents’ and adolescents’ HPV vaccination acceptability. We used face-to-face methods to recruit participants 
from three local churches in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Participants completed pre- and post-intervention assessments 
based on the validated Theory of Planned Behavior survey. We organized two face-to-face presentations for parents and
adolescents separately. The intervention showed that for every one-unit  increase in the participants’ self-confidence and attitude scores, 
the odds of the HPV vaccination acceptability increases. Intention for vaccine acceptance, and attitude toward vaccination, 
were significantly  higher among parents than adolescents, after controlling for the baseline scores. These findings suggest that the intervention targeting parents’ 
and adolescents’ attitudes and knowledge has the potential to increase HPV vaccination acceptance in Ghana.
